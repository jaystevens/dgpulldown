Dear User:

Included here is a Linux and Mac OSX version of dgpulldown.  Dgpulldown
was created by Donald A Graft under the GNU GPL License 2.  This version
is based on Version 1.0.11.  Modifications include removal of Windows
specific code as well as the features for rewriting a file in place and
for dumping the time code.  A new option -interlaced has been added to
allow changing the field dominance of interlaced source.  This option
should not be used in conjuction with any of pulldown options.

To flag an interlaced m2v file as top field first use the command

    dgpulldown input.m2v -interlaced -o output.m2v

to flag an interlaced m2v file as bottom field first use the command

    dgpulldown input.m2v -interlaced -bff -o output.m2v

Comments on the modification can be sent to video@renomath.org.  Much
thanks goes to Donald Graft

Sincerely,
